# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the project, including how to run tests, the testing framework used, and guidelines for writing new tests.

## Testing Framework

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```

This will execute all unit tests and integration tests in the project.

## Writing New Tests

When writing new tests, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability:

1. **Test Structure**: Organize your tests using the `describe` and `test` functions provided by Jest. Use `describe` to group related tests and `test` to define individual test cases.

2. **Assertions**: Use Jest's built-in assertion methods to verify the expected behavior of your code. Commonly used assertion methods include `expect`, `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toHaveBeenCalled`, and `toThrow`.

3. **Mocking**: Use Jest's mocking capabilities to mock dependencies and isolate the code under test. This is especially useful for testing components that rely on external services or APIs.

4. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage by writing tests for all critical components and functions. Use Jest's code coverage tool to identify untested parts of the codebase.

5. **Error Handling**: Write tests to verify that your code handles errors gracefully. This includes testing edge cases and invalid inputs.

6. **Performance**: Ensure that your tests run efficiently and do not introduce significant overhead. Avoid unnecessary setup and teardown operations.

7. **Documentation**: Document your tests with comments to explain the purpose and expected behavior of each test case. This helps other developers understand the tests and maintain them in the future.

## Example Test

Here is an example of a simple test case for a function that adds two numbers:

```javascript
// add.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;

// add.test.js
const add = require('./add');

describe('add', () => {
  test('adds two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });

  test('adds negative numbers', () => {
    expect(add(-1, -2)).toBe(-3);
  });
});
```

In this example, the `add` function is tested with both positive and negative numbers to ensure it behaves correctly in different scenarios.

## Conclusion

By following this testing strategy, you can ensure that your code is reliable, maintainable, and free of bugs. Regularly run tests and update them as your codebase evolves to maintain high quality standards.
